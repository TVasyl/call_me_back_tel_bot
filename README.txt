This is a simple form in web site with input data validation and sending them to Telegram-bot. 
In page it's just look like "call me back please". Then bot receives message with text "My name is xxxx, 
call me back please on this nomber: xxxx." For validation of phone nomber i  used "inputmask". 
Also i created siple server and it's give you more opportunity to extand your code and make your data more secure.
